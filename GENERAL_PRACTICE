Top 10 C++ Operator Interview Questions (Concise Summary with Code)
1. The Sequence Point Trap
Question: What is the output of the following code? Code:

C++
int i = 10;
i = i++ + ++i; // Undefined Behavior
cout << i;
Correct Answer: Undefined Behavior Key Logic: The variable i is modified more than once within a single expression without a sequence point. The C++ standard does not define the order in which the increments happen relative to the assignment, making the result compiler-dependent and unsafe.   

2. Efficient Power of 2 Check
Question: Which method checks if n is a power of 2 in O(1)? Code:

C++
bool isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
    // Returns true if n is positive and has only one bit set
    return (n > 0) && ((n & (n - 1)) == 0); 
}
Correct Answer: Bitwise Method Key Logic: Subtracting 1 from a power of 2 (e.g., 1000 -> 0111) flips all bits up to the rightmost set bit. Using Bitwise AND & on them results in 0. This operation is atomic and faster than division loops.   

3. Logical Short-Circuiting
Question: What is the final value of y? Code:

C++
int x = 10, y = 5;
if (x > 20 && ++y > 5) {
    // 'x > 20' is false, so '++y' is skipped
}
cout << y; // Prints 5
Correct Answer: 5 (unchanged) Key Logic: The Logical AND (&&) operator evaluates left-to-right. Since x > 20 is False, the result is determined immediately. The right side (++y) is skipped (short-circuited) and never executes.   

4. Ternary Operator Type Promotion
Question: What is the type and value of result? Code:

C++
// 10 (int) is promoted to 10.0 (double) to match 10.5
auto result = (true)? 10 : 10.5; 
cout << result; // Prints 10.5
Correct Answer: 10.5 (double) Key Logic: The ternary operator ?: must return a single common type. The compiler implicitly promotes the int (10) to a double (10.0) to match the precision of the second option (10.5).   

5. Array Decay & sizeof
Question: What is the output inside the function? Code:

C++
void func(int arr) {
    // arr decays to int* (pointer)
    cout << sizeof(arr); // Prints 4 (32-bit) or 8 (64-bit)
}
int main() {
    int arr[8];
    func(arr);
}
Correct Answer: Pointer Size (4 or 8 bytes) Key Logic: When an array is passed to a function, it "decays" into a pointer to its first element. You are printing the size of a pointer (int*), not the actual array size.   

6. Relational Associativity
Question: What is the value of result? Code:

C++
// Evaluated as ((30 > 20) > 10) -> (1 > 10) -> 0
int result = 30 > 20 > 10; 
cout << result; // Prints 0
Correct Answer: 0 (False) Key Logic: Relational operators are left-associative.

(30 > 20) evaluates to 1 (True).

The expression becomes 1 > 10, which is False (0).   

7. Assignment vs. Equality
Question: Which block executes? Code:

C++
int x = 10;
if (x = 5) { // Assigns 5 to x, returns 5 (True)
    cout << "True Block";
} else {
    cout << "False Block";
}
Correct Answer: True Block Key Logic: This is an assignment (=), not a comparison (==). The expression assigns 5 to x and returns 5. Since 5 is non-zero, the if condition is treated as True.   

8. The Comma Operator
Question: What is the value of z? Code:

C++
// Evaluates 10, then 20, then returns 30
int z = (10, 20, 30); 
cout << z; // Prints 30
Correct Answer: 30 Key Logic: The comma operator evaluates operands from left to right and discards all results except the last one. z is assigned the final value in the sequence.   

9. Negative Modulus (C++11)
Question: What is the result? Code:

C++
// Sign matches the dividend (-5)
int res = -5 % 2; 
cout << res; // Prints -1
Correct Answer: -1 Key Logic: Since C++11, integer division truncates toward zero. The sign of the remainder always matches the sign of the dividend (the first number). Since -5 is negative, the result is negative.   

10. Empty Class Size
Question: What is the size of an empty class? Code:

C++
class Empty {};
// Non-zero to ensure unique address
cout << sizeof(Empty); // Prints 1
